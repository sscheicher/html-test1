    <h1>Nico</h1>
    <p>Nico is a Yellow Canary and Pedro's best friend. He and Pedro meet with Blu when he first came to Rio de Janeiro and gave advice on how to attract Jewel (which did not work). Nico wears a blue-green bottle cap as a hat, which he can also use as a tambourine and a weapon, similar to a frisbee. He also runs a Samba Club with Pedro and Kipo within the marketplace of Rio. He is one of the three tritagonists of Rio and Rio 2, with the other two being Rafael and Pedro.</p>
